# Oulipo Variations

A play on the [N+7 Machine](http://www.spoonbill.org/n+7/) by the French Oulipo poets. The N+7 procedure, invented in 1961 by Jean Lescure, involves replacing each noun in a text with the seventh one following it in a dictionary.

Playful variations created for the School for Poetic Computation class: Let's Play: Wayward Sentences, taught by Kameelah Janan Rasheed and Shiraz Abdullahi Gallab. Built with the spaCy Python natural language processing library, DataMuse API for rhymes, Midi.js for the jukebox, and a minimalist Flask application deployed on PythonAnywhere.
